<!---
First exercise is a python scrypt to check if a password has been "pwned" (i.e. published as part of someone's hack).
It uses a service from https://haveibeenpwned.com OR a local list of hashes (you can download one from the same site).
I am NOT affiliate with the site in any way. This is just a python exercise.
Type "Python pwned.py--help" for a list of parameters you and use (and some example)
